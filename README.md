# The POC and Tests project

This is a simple project to collect tests I've done, either out of pure interest or in response to some forum and/or StackOverflow posts.

## Sub Modules - done

 * `simple-tests-fx` - simple projects to test some aspects of JavaFX
 * `guice-fx` - simple project to show, how to build a simple JavaFX project with Guice DI

## Sub Modules - to do
 * `spring-boot-fx` - as the `guice-fx` module, this is intended to show how to use Spring Boot (DI) with JavaFX
 * `kotlin-java-mix` - while using JavaFX to start a `Stage`, this is just a showcase for a MAven project setup where both Java and Kotlin are set up together in one project
 * `kotlin-guice-fx` - simple `Kotlin` project with a bit of Guice thrown onto it
